# Foreign Direct Investment & Financial Risk Analysis Model

**Oracle SQL Object-Relational Structures + Interactive Visualizations in Power BI**

## 🔍 Project Description

This project leverages the power of Oracle’s object-relational databases, combined with exploratory analysis in Python and interactive dashboards in Power BI, to analyze the evolution of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as a % of GDP across key economies between 2000 and 2023.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze historical FDI as % of GDP by country and year.
- Identify countries with the highest and lowest capital attraction levels.
- Develop a basic model of financial risk and investment dispersion.
- Visualize data dynamically to enhance interpretation and decision-making.

## 📊 Economic Summary

Ireland shows a remarkable performance in the FDI (% of GDP) time series, reaching a peak near **74.75%**, positioning it as the country with the highest recorded FDI during the period. In contrast, the United States shows the lowest positive value at **0.64%**.

This dispersion suggests structural differences in economic and fiscal models. A first hypothesis indicates that **Ireland’s low-tax model** could have encouraged more volatile capital flows. Future versions of this analysis may include additional economic variables to assess country risk more rigorously.
